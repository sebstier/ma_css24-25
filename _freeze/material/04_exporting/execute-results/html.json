The only thing that needs to be changed is the documents \"configuration\".\nQuarto documents are configured via a YAML header.\n\n# What is YAML?\n\n- YAML stands for \"YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language\" (It rhymes with \"camel\")\n\n- YAML is a very simple, text-based, human-readable language used to exchange data between people and computers.\n\n- YAML is not a programming language but used for storing configuration information.\n\n- YAML stores data. It does not include commands and instructions.\n\n- YAML is similar to XML or JSON but much more human readable and concise.\n\n# Configuring Quarto via YAML\n\n## Single Document\n\nA single `.qmd` document always starts with a YAML header. The minimum working header just includes the format of the document.[^1]\n\n```yml\n---\nformat: html\n---\n```\n\nTo specify options for html use the following.\n\n\n```{yml}\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n---\n```\n\n\nYAML is very sensitive to malformed instructions.\nCreate a default quarto document in RStudio (*File > New File > Quarto Document...*) and add a (random) title.\nReplace the YAML header with each of the following:\n\n\n```{yml}\n---\nformat:html\n---\n```\n\n```{yml}\n---\nformat: \nhtml\n---\n```\n\n```{md}\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n---\n```\n\n\nObserve the outcome when rendering and try to identify the source of error if there is one.\n\n[^1]: If you create a new document via RStudio (*File > New File > Quarto Document...*) then you are also required to add a title.\n\n\n## Project\n\n*(Projects will become important when discussing websites)*\n\n\n\n\n# Exercise\n\nTry to export your CV to PDF and/or MS Word\n\n",
