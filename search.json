    "text": "Lecturer\nSebastian Stier\nProfessor @ University of Mannheim & Scientific Director Department Computational Social Science @ GESIS\n\nAbout the course\nComputational Social Science (CSS) is a young research field at the intersection of various social science disciplines, data science and computer science. The goal is to gain new insights into society through large amounts of data and the direct observation of human behavior. CSS relies on two cornerstones: digital behavioral data, which can be collected from online platforms or sensors like smartphones, and computer science methods such as automated text analysis to create appropriate measures for social science research questions. In the course, students will get to know foundational studies, theories and methods used in the field of CSS. We will discuss infrastructural, ethical and legal challenges and how to navigate these to devise appropriate research designs in CSS.\nThe course will be application oriented. Students will familiarize themselves with the main applications of CSS methods and implement them in R. The range of applications will cover data management and preprocessing, the application of machine learning, data and results visualization, statistical data analysis and the validation of results. The hands-on application examples will cover questions from various research fields and different data types like social media data or web browsing histories. Equipped with this theoretical and methodological toolkit, students will develop their own CSS research projects.\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeminar dates and topics\n\n\nDate\nTopics\nRequired reading\n\n\n\n\n3 September 2024\n\nIntroduction and expectations\nFoundations of CSS\nGetting started in R\n\n\n\n\n11 September 2024\n\nFoundations of CSS\nThe R tidyverse\n\nLazer, D., & Radford, J.

Causal research that asks the question why has largely taken the place of descriptive research that asks the question what. Gerring (2012) diagnosed a general tendency to dismiss ‘Mere Description’ as a ‘mundane task … of little intrinsic scientific value,’ advocating instead that it be taken seriously as part of the general social scientific method.\nWe firmly agree. However, critique alone does not change the material conditions and incentives of practicing academics; we see this journal as a practical step towards raising the status of description as a method.” (Munger, Guess, and Hargittai 2021: 3-4)"
