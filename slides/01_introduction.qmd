## Learning objectives (on MA level)

1. Advanced understanding of concepts, methods, data used and challenges in CSS
2. Critical reflection of the applicability of CSS in social science research
3. Learning to use CSS methods in R
4. Application of CSS methods in R for own research question


## Modus operandi in the class
- Introduction to the session's topic by instructor
- Required reading: (mostly) applied papers
  - We'll discuss these papers in the class
- We'll code in the class $\rightarrow$ please bring your laptop
- Questions are always possible, this is supposed to be interactive 


## Requirements for examination/grades
:::{.incremental}
- Regular participation in class
- Writing a review of the required readings for **two** classes to be submitted by Sunday evening before the respective class (**Studienleistung/Coursework**)
- Presentation of your own research idea for your term paper in the last 3 classes of the semester
- Written term paper based on an analysis in R (3,000-5,000 words), deadline: 31 January 2025 (**Pr√ºfungsleistung/Examination**)

:::

## Format of the reviews
- Guiding questions:

::: {style="font-size: 90%;"}
    - Describe what problem or question these papers address and the main contributions that they make towards a solution or answer. 
    
    - Reflect on the main strengths and weaknesses of these papers.
    
    - What are the concepts, assumed social mechanisms and operationalizations used in the papers?
    
    - What are the data in use? How are the data analyzed? Does this seem appropriate?
    
    - How convincing do you find the arguments presented by the authors? Are the conclusions backed up by the empirical results?
    
    - Do you see any ethical concerns?
    
    - If papers are empirical, how do you judge their replicability?
    
    - If applicable, are there commonalities or differences between the two papers? How do they relate to each other?
    
:::

## Format of term paper (3,000-5,000 words)
- Brief motivation and research question
- Concise theoretical overview: for what conceptual and theoretical reasons do I choose these data and methods?
- Research design
- Data and variables
- Method: no detailed mathematical description needed, but why does this method fit my research question and my data?
- Results
- Interpretation and conclusions
- Analysis code as an R script: needs to be fully reproducible


## Information management and communication

- Slides and materials will be online: [https://sebastianstier.com/ma_css24-25](https://sebastianstier.com/ma_css24-25)
- Communication
    - Via [email](mailto:sebastian.stier@gesis.org)
    - In person after the class
    - Via Zoom
- Submit the final term paper to [sebastian.stier@gesis.org](mailto:sebastian.stier@gesis.org)
- Data and scripts can be shared via the secure platform Cryptshare: [https://cryptshare.gesis.org](https://cryptshare.gesis.org)

:::{.incremental}

- It's fine to look for help online but without an understanding of the R code base the use of AI is inefficient.
- You'll learn much more if you try to find a solution within-R, e.g., *?mean*
- We will code in class $\rightarrow$ applied programming.
- Term paper: 
  - Synthesis of theory, research question and code.
  - Documentation of code: tell me why each step is needed and what it does.
