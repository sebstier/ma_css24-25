- It's fine to look for help online but without an understanding of the R code base the use of AI is inefficient.
- You'll learn much more if you try to find a solution within-R, e.g., *?mean*
- We will code in class $\rightarrow$ applied programming.
- Term paper: 
  - Synthesis of theory, research question and code.
  - Documentation of code: tell me why each step is needed and what it does.

## Before we really get started with coding...

A simple ggplot figure.

<div class=small-code>
```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: column
#| code-line-numbers: "6|7|8|9|10|11"

library(ggplot2)
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  # ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +    
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
  theme_minimal()

```

##

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: fragment

library(ggplot2)
    mtcars %>%ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg))+geom_point() +geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x")+theme_minimal()
    
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: fragment

library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(mtcars,aes(x=disp, y=mpg))+geom_point()+
      geom_smooth(method="loess",formula="y~x")+theme_minimal()

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#| echo: fenced
#| output-location: fragment

library(ggplot2)
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x")

```

. . .

Luckily, there is guidance: [https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html)

```{r, eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
```

## Some definitions I

We define CSS as the development and application of computational methods to complex, typically large-scale, human (sometimes simulated) behavioral data (1). [...] Whereas traditional quantitative social science has focused on rows of cases and columns of variables, typically with assumptions of independence among observations, CSS encompasses language, location and movement, networks, images, and video, with the application of statistical models that capture multifarious dependencies within data.

:::

## Some definitions II

Computational social science is an interdisciplinary field that advances theories of human behavior by applying computational techniques to large datasets from social media sites, the Internet, or other digitized archives such as administrative records. Our definition forefronts sociological theory because we believe the future of the field within sociology depends not only on novel data sources and methods, but also on its capacity to produce new theories of human behavior or elaborate on existing explanations of the social world.

## Advantages of digital behavioral data

:::: {.incremental}
Digital behavioral data capture human behavior...

- non-intrusively,

- reliably,

- with fine-grained and multi-dimensional features,

- across time and contexts.

::::

## Downsides of digital behavioral data

:::: {.incremental}

But, digital behavioral data...

- come in large volumes,

- are unstructured,

- are multi-dimensional (text, images, videos, audio, ...),

- are often produced and provided with minimal or no information on the data generating process.

::::

. . . 

$\rightarrow$ Analyzing digital behavioral data in a scientifically meaningful way is an immense challenge


## The role of theory and existing knowledge

"Our definition forefronts sociological theory because we believe the future of the field within sociology depends not only on novel data sources and methods, but also on its capacity to produce new theories of human behavior or elaborate on existing explanations of the social world." [@edelmann_computational_2020: 62]

"First and foremost, we respond to an undersupply of quantitative descriptive research in social science. Causal research that asks the question why has largely taken the place of descriptive research that asks the question what. Gerring (2012) diagnosed a general tendency to dismiss 'Mere Description' as a 'mundane task ... of little intrinsic scientific value,' advocating instead that it be taken seriously as part of the general social scientific method. 

We firmly agree. However, critique alone does not change the material conditions and incentives of practicing academics; we see this journal as a practical step towards raising the status of description as a method." [@munger_quantitative_2021: 3-4]

Second, rather than define our new venue in terms of existing disciplinary boundaries, we instead embrace a topical focus on digital media, broadly construed. We argue that the centrality and dynamism of digital media — information and communication technologies, including social media, that increasingly structure the way people interact with the world — necessitates increased scholarly energy devoted to sustained, continuous, quantitative description. [...] 

Today, there are more hours of video uploaded to YouTube every day than were broadcast in the 1950s U.S. in a year. The daily content of Twitter is different (and different in unpredictable ways) than it was the day before." [@munger_quantitative_2021: 3-4]

## Examples of novel sociotechnical phenomena

- Harmful online communication
  - E.g., misinformation and deception
  - E.g., violent language, harassment, racism
- Algorithmic influence, bias and discrimination
- Filter bubbles and echo chambers
- Social bots 
- Virality of online content and memes
- Online inequalities
